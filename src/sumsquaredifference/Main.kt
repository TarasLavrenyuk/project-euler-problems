 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is: 12+22+...+102=385
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is: (1+2+...+10)2=552=3025
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is 3025âˆ’385=2640.
 *
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
